# REST_API
I created a REST API project using Java Spring Boot, enabling functionalities to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data. The API interacts with a MySQL database, allowing seamless data management. This project enhanced my skills in backend development and provided hands-on experience with Spring Boot's features. Itâ€™s a solid foundation for building scalable web applications!
